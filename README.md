# Work Day Scheduler

# Description

This webpage is a daily work day planner. When the page loads you will see the current date and time displayed at the top. When you scroll down you will see time blocks for standard business hours, the time blocks are color-coded to show past, present, and future. When you click a time block you can add an event and save it to the local storage, if the page gets refreshed the saved events should persist. The clear schedule button will clear the schedule and local storage.
